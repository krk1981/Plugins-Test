## Important Note: Scope Update

The email analysis revealed a **broader scope** than previously documented. The proposal covers:
- **E-commerce platform** (online ordering, home delivery, click-and-collect) — *new finding*
- **Inventory management** and AI-driven demand forecasting — *previously documented*

Updated sales plan and project plan reflect the full e-commerce + digitization scope.
