I'll help you work on the M-Market Finland digitization proposal. Let me start by reading the sales knowledge base and then checking what's already available for this project.

> **Read** `artifacts/m-market-finland/knowledge-base.md`

Let me check what files already exist for this M-Market Finland project:

> **Glob** `artifacts/m-market-finland/*`

Let me read the existing files to understand the current status of the M-Market Finland project:

> **Read** `artifacts/m-market-finland/deal-summary.md`

> **Read** `artifacts/m-market-finland/sales-plan.md`

> **Read** `artifacts/m-market-finland/confluence-publication-plan.md`

Now let me check what MCP resources are available for accessing emails and Confluence:

> **ListMcpResourcesTool** {}

Let me check if I have access to Atlassian/Confluence tools:

> **mcp__atlassian__atlassianUserInfo** {}

> **mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources** {}

I can see you have comprehensive materials prepared for the M-Market Finland digitization proposal, but I don't have access to your email system or Confluence instance (getting 401 authentication errors). Let me organize the work that needs to be done and provide you with everything needed to complete these tasks.

Now I'll create the email action summary and prepare your Confluence publication materials:
