I'll help you set up a comprehensive deal workspace for M-Market Finland. Let me start by reading the sales knowledge base to ensure I apply the best practices, then assess the current state and create the necessary deliverables.

> **Read** `artifacts/m-market-finland/knowledge-base.md`

Let me check what's already in the artifacts directory and then read the knowledge base in sections:

> **Bash** `Check existing files in M-Market Finland workspace`

> **Read** `artifacts/m-market-finland/knowledge-base.md`

Let me search for key sections related to proposal writing and deal management:

> **Grep** `proposal|deal|project-plan` in `artifacts/m-market-finland/knowledge-base.md`

> **Grep** `Skill:.*proposal|Skill:.*deal` in `artifacts/m-market-finland/knowledge-base.md`

> **Read** `artifacts/m-market-finland/knowledge-base.md` (lines 2094-2294)

Perfect! I now understand the deal workspace methodology. Let me create a structured approach for the M-Market Finland deal. I'll start by creating a todo list to track this multi-step process:

> **Update Todos** Research M-Market Finland company profil, Analyze digitization trends in Finnish m, Create MEDDPICC-based sales plan for M-M

Now let me start with researching M-Market Finland. I'll begin by gathering comprehensive company and market intelligence:
