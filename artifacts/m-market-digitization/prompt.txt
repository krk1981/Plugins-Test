## Task: m-market-digitization
**M-Market Digitization**

## Description
Work on the M-Market digitization proposal. Check my emails and publish plans to Confluence

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  (no file restrictions — you may modify any file)

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.
