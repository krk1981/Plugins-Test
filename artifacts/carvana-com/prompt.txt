## Task: carvana-com
**carvana.com)**

## Description
Research Acme Corp (carvana.com) and prepare a comprehensive prospect brief:
- Company overview: size, revenue, industry, key products
- Recent news and press releases (last 6 months)
- Key decision makers (CEO, CTO, VP Sales)
- Technology stack they use (if discoverable)
- Potential pain points our product could solve
- Recommended talking points for initial outreach

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  (no file restrictions — you may modify any file)

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.
