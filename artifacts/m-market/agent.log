### Current Status: Proposal Stage

The M-Market modernization is in its **initial proposal/pre-sales phase**. Here's the key progress:

**What's been shared in email:**
- A full business case was submitted for digitizing M-Market Finland
- The proposal covers online ordering, home delivery, and click-and-collect services
- The deal is being positioned for internal sales review and CTO engagement

**Current Situation:**
| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Digital presence | None (100% offline) |
| Online ordering | Not yet implemented |
| Proposal submission | Done (Feb 24, 2026) |
| Internal sales review | Pending |
| CTO technical meeting | Pending scheduling |
| Contract | Not yet signed |

**Key Stakeholders:**
| Role | Contact |
|------|---------|
| Sales Deal Review Head | ravikanth.kotapati@gmail.com |
| Client CTO | manmadharao.baipalli@capgemini.com |
| Project Manager | mdrao.b@gmail.com |

**Proposed Implementation Roadmap:**
1. **Phase 1 (0-3 months):** Requirements & design
2. **Phase 2 (4-8 months):** Core platform development + payment gateway
3. **Phase 3 (9-12 months):** Pilot rollout to selected stores
4. **Phase 4 (12-18 months):** Nationwide rollout

**Projected Business Impact:** 10-20% revenue increase in Year 2

### Bottom Line

The M-Market modernization is at the **very beginning** — a business case was just sent 3 days ago (Feb 24). There are **no emails showing further progress** since the proposal submission. The immediate next steps are:
1. Schedule the CTO technical deep-dive
2. Complete the internal sales deal review
3. Get contract signed within the 30-day target window

No implementation work has started yet. The project is still in the sales/proposal phase.
