## Daily Sales Briefing — Feb 26, 2026

### Pipeline Health: MODERATE

| Deal | Value | Health |
|------|-------|--------|
| M-Market Finland Digitization | €2.5–3.5M | 🟡 Watch |
| Carvana (US) | TBD | 🔴 At Risk |
| M-Market General | €350–400K | 🟡 Watch |

### At-Risk Deals
1. **Carvana** — Research is done but zero outreach has happened. The post-earnings window is the optimal entry point and it's closing fast.
2. **M-Market Finland CFO** — Saara Lindberg (budget gatekeeper) is "Cautious" and the executive presentation is in 5 days. An ROI model tuned to her concerns is not yet confirmed ready.

### Top 3 Priority Actions Today
1. **Finalize CFO-grade ROI model for M-Market Finland** — Executive presentation is March 3; needs to be done by Feb 28 at the latest.
2. **Initiate Carvana outreach today** — Target CPO Dan Gill with a reconditioning-automation angle tied to their Q4 earnings commentary.
3. **Deduplicate M-Market vs. M-Market Finland deals** — Two parallel tracks risk conflicting communications; consolidate by Feb 27.
