## Pipeline Health Summary

| Deal | Stage | Value | Close Prob | Close Target | Health |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| M-Market Finland Digitization | Proposal / Pre-Board | €2.5–3.5M | 80–85% | Q2 2026 | 🟡 Watch |
| Carvana (US) | Prospect Research | TBD | <20% | TBD | 🔴 At Risk |
| M-Market (General) | Proposal Drafted | €350–400K | ~50% | TBD | 🟡 Watch |

**Overall pipeline health: MODERATE.** One deal is in active, progressing stages (M-Market Finland) but has an imminent board-approval dependency. One prospect (Carvana) has solid research but zero active engagement. A third deal (M-Market general) lacks confirmed stakeholder buy-in.

## Deal Snapshots

### 1. M-Market Finland Digitization — 🟡 Watch
- **Value:** €2.5–3.5M over 18 months
- **Status:** Proposal delivered February 24; executive presentation scheduled March 3
- **Key contacts:** CEO Mika Virtanen (positive), CTO Laura Korhonen (positive/champion), CFO Saara Lindberg (cautious — budget gatekeeper), Ops Director Jukka Nieminen (neutral)
- **Decision timeline:** Technical evaluation March 2026 → Board approval April 2026 → Contract Q2 2026
- **Recent activity:** Full proposal, sales plan, implementation roadmap, and Confluence-ready materials produced

### 2. Carvana (US) — 🔴 At Risk
- **Value:** Not yet scoped
- **Status:** Deep prospect research completed; **no outreach initiated**
- **Key contacts:** CPO Dan Gill (tech decisions), CEO Ernie Garcia III, CFO Mark Jenkins
- **Opportunity:** Reconditioning automation, inventory management at scale, AI customer-service — all identified pain points
- **Risk:** Research freshness degrading; strong Q4 2025 earnings mean budget exists now but deal window may narrow if another vendor reaches them first

### 3. M-Market (General Retail Digitization) — 🟡 Watch
- **Value:** ~€350–400K
- **Status:** Proposal and competitive positioning prepared; formal pipeline entry and stakeholder buy-in not confirmed
- **Risk:** Appears to have been superseded by the more comprehensive M-Market Finland engagement; needs deduplication and prioritization clarity

## At-Risk Deals

### 🔴 Carvana — No Active Engagement
**Risk:** Prospect research was completed February 22 and now sits idle. Every day without outreach increases the risk of a competitor engaging first. Carvana announced record 2025 results (Feb 18) and is in active expansion mode — this is the optimal window.
**Required action:** Begin outreach immediately targeting CPO Dan Gill or COO Ben Huston with operational-efficiency angle.

### 🟡 M-Market Finland — CFO Not Yet Aligned
**Risk:** CFO Saara Lindberg is "Cautious" and controls budget approval. The executive presentation is March 3 — **5 days away** — and a detailed, CFO-grade ROI model has not been confirmed as ready. If Saara is not adequately prepared before the board review, the April budget approval will slip, pushing close to Q3 or beyond and increasing competitive exposure from SAP/Oracle Retail/Microsoft Dynamics.

## Top 3 Priority Actions for Today

### 1. 🔥 Finalize ROI Model for M-Market Finland CFO — Due Before March 3
The executive presentation to CEO Mika Virtanen and CFO Saara Lindberg is in **5 days**. The CFO is the most cautious stakeholder and holds budget approval authority. Prepare a dedicated, numbers-first ROI presentation targeting her concerns:
- Finnish market benchmarks for inventory waste reduction
- 18-month payback narrative with conservative assumptions
- Phased investment breakdown (reduces perceived risk)
- Sensitivity analysis showing downside case still achieves positive NPV

**Owner:** Account Executive / Pre-sales
**Deadline:** EOD February 28 (leaves one day buffer for review)

### 2. 🔥 Initiate Carvana Outreach — Today
Research is stale after four days without contact. Carvana's Q4 earnings call and record results (Feb 18) create a natural "congratulations + value-add" hook. Send a personalized LinkedIn or email outreach to:
- **Primary target:** Dan Gill (Chief Product Officer) — owns technology decisions
- **Secondary target:** Ben Huston (COO) — owns operational scaling
- **Angle:** Reconditioning capacity automation (explicitly called out as a Q4 pain point)

**Owner:** BDR / Account Executive
**Deadline:** Today, February 26

### 3. Clarify M-Market (General) vs. M-Market Finland — Deduplication
Two separate deal tracks for M-Market risk creating conflicting communications and wasted effort. Determine whether:
- The general M-Market deal is the same company as M-Market Finland (likely yes — consolidate into one deal)
- Or a separate entity requiring independent pursuit

If they are the same, archive the general track artifacts under the Finland deal and ensure all stakeholders and contacts are unified in one CRM record.

**Owner:** Sales Ops / Deal Owner
**Deadline:** February 27
