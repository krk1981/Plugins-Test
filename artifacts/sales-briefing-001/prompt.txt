## Task: sales-briefing-001
**Daily Sales Briefing**

## Description
Run the daily-briefing skill for the sales team. Summarize pipeline health, flag any at-risk deals, and list the top 3 priority actions for today.

## File Constraints
You may ONLY modify these files (other files are locked by other agents working in parallel):
  (no file restrictions — you may modify any file)

If you need to create new files, place them under the directories implied by the locked file paths.
Do NOT modify files outside your assigned scope — doing so will cause merge conflicts.
