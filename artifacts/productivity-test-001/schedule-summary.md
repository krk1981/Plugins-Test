# Schedule Summary — 2026-02-27

**Task:** productivity-test-001
**Requested skill:** `my-schedule`
**Status:** Skill not available

## Result

The `my-schedule` skill was not found in the loaded skill set for this session.
The only skill currently registered is `keybindings-help`.

No calendar data source or meeting integration is configured in this workspace, so today's meetings cannot be retrieved automatically.

## What to do next

To enable calendar lookups, one of the following must be set up:

1. **Register a `my-schedule` skill** in the productivity plugin (e.g., a skill that calls Google Calendar, Outlook, or another calendar API).
2. **Configure calendar credentials** (OAuth token, API key, etc.) so the skill can authenticate with the calendar provider.
3. **Re-run this task** once the skill is available.

Until then, no meeting data can be provided for today (2026-02-27).
